          I am a Computer Science graduate from Binus University with interests in UI/UX, product development, React, and modern web technologies. I’ve built applications such as a POS System (Brewsy), E-learning prototype, and a Menu App using React + Firebase. I focus on user-centered design and creating smooth digital experiences.
